## I needed to check the following on over 100 SQL instances
## 
## SQL Agent
##             Should Be Running
##             Should be set to auto-start
## SQL Agent Jobs
##     There should be the following jobs
##             CommandLog Cleanup                                        
##             DatabaseBackup - SYSTEM_DATABASES - FULL                    
##             DatabaseBackup - USER_DATABASES - DIFF                    
##             DatabaseBackup - USER_DATABASES - FULL                      
##             DatabaseBackup - USER_DATABASES - LOG                     
##             DatabaseIntegrityCheck - SYSTEM_DATABASES                 
##             DatabaseIntegrityCheck - USER_DATABASES                   
##             IndexOptimize - USER_DATABASES                            
##             sp_delete_backuphistory                                   
##             sp_purge_jobhistory                                       
##             syspolicy_purge_history         
##     Each Job should
##             exist
##             have run successfully
##             be scheduled
## Files
##             There should be a backup share folder for the server
##             There should be a folder for each database
##             For databases in full recovery there should be a FULL DIFF and LOG folder
##             For system databases, databases in simple recovery and Log shipped databases there should be FULL and DIFF folders
##             Each FULL folder should have files less than 7 days old
##             Each DIFF folder should have files less than 24 hours old
##             Each LOG folder should have files less than 30 minutes old
## 
##    Not a quick task and as you can imagine prone to human mistakes
