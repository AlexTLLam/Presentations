You will also find a docker-compose file in the [Repository](https://github.com/SQLDBAWithABeard/Presentations/blob/master/Notebooks/dbachecks-historical/docker-compose.yml) which you can use to spin up a SQL container and restore the backup. (Yes, I know I could have created a container with the database already embedded but this gives you more things to learn about!)\r\n\r\nThe docker-compose file looks like this\r\n````\r\nversion: '3.7'\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n    HistoricalReporting:\r\n        image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-CTP2.4-ubuntu\r\n        ports:  \r\n          - \"15594:1433\"\r\n        environment:\r\n          SA_PASSWORD: \"Password0!\"\r\n          ACCEPT_EULA: \"Y\"\r\n        volumes: \r\n          - C:\\dbachecks:/var/opt/mssql/backups\r\n````\r\nIt will create \r\n\r\n- a single service (a container (See the [Docker Documentation for a full definition of a service](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part3/))) called `HistoricalReporting`\r\n- assign port 1433 on the container to port 15594 on the host\r\n- add the environmental variables for the SA Password and the acceptance of the EULA\r\n- map the directory c:\\dbachecks on the host (your laptop) to the directory /var/opt/mssql/backups in the container\r\n\r\nIt will create the container using the Community Technical Preview 2.4 image of SQL Server 2019 running on Ubuntu from the Microsoft Container Registry for SQL Server.\r\n\r\nDownload the backup file and the docker-compose.yml and save it in a folder, I am going to assume that you are using `C:\\dbachecks` for the rest of this notebook.\r\n\r\nYou can, and should, understand how to change those values in the docker-compose file for different values so that you can spin up a container with a different image (maybe a later or earlier versions of SQL Server) or store your files in a different directory to `C:\\dbachecks` or becuase you are allergic to `Password0!`\r\n\r\nOnce your docker-compose.yml file is ready open PowerShell (Windows or Core both will work) and type\r\n\r\nSet-Location c:\\dbachecks\r\ndocker-compose up -d\r\n\r\n````\r\nSet-Location c:\\dbachecks\r\ndocker-compose up -d\r\n````\r\n\r\n<a href=\"command:workbench.action.terminal.focus\">Or In Azure Data Studio you can click this link to open a new terminal'</a>\r\n\r\nand then \r\n\r\n<a href=\"command:workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence?%7B%22text%22%3A%22Set-Location C:%5C%5Cdbachecks%22%7D\">Paste in the Set-Location code by clicking this link</a> \r\n\r\n<a href=\"command:workbench.action.terminal.focus\">Click this link to focus the terminal and press enter</a> \r\n\r\n<a href=\"command:workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence?%7B%22text%22%3A%22docker-compose up -d%22%7D\">Paste in the docker-compose up -d code by clicking this link</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"command:workbench.action.terminal.focus\">Click this link to focus the terminal and press enter</a> \r\n\r\nYou should see  \r\n  \r\n![alt text](https://github.com/SQLDBAWithABeard/Presentations/blob/master/Notebooks/dbachecks-historical/docker-compose-up.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
