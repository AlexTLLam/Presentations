#
# Four things you need to know to effectively use PowerShell
#
############################################################
#
#
# When you start you don't know the name of the command
#
# So Use Get-Command
# Get-Command ## This takes too long to be able to fit in a 5 minute lightning talk - delete the first # and run to see all the commands
#
# The * is a wild card
#
Get-Command *backup*
# Get returns
#
Get-Command Get-E*
# Set defines 
#
Get-command Set-C*
# New creates 
#
Get-Command New-V*
# There are a lot of Verbs 
#
Get-Verb
# So think of the thing you want to do
#
Get-Command *Backup*Database
# So now you need to know how to use the command that you have found
#
Get-Help
# Lets get the help for Backup-SQLDatabase
#
Get-Help Backup-SqlDatabase 
# Good but long, confusing at first - Don't forget about it, you will need it later
# But there is some help for you on the screen to make it easier to begin
#
Get-Help Backup-SqlDatabase -Examples 
# The Backup-SqlDatabase cmdlet performs backup operations on a SQL Server database.
#    
#    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------
#    
#    C:\PS>Backup-SqlDatabase -ServerInstance Computer\Instance -Database MyDB
#    
#    
#    Description
#    
#    -----------
#    
#    This command creates a complete database backup of the database 'MyDB' to the 
#    default backup location of the server instance Computer\Instance'. The backup file 
#    will be named 'MyDB.bak'.
########################################################################################
#
# This will not work if you don't have SQL installed
# Find another command to practice with using Get-Command
#
Backup-SqlDatabase -ServerInstance . -Database DBADatabase
# I will show the Default Backup Directory. Look at the LastWriteTime
# If you don't have a C:\MSSQL\Backup directory this will fail try another directory with the ls command alias
#
ls C:\MSSQL\Backup
cd C:\MSSQL\Backup
# sneakily I showed you that you can use cmd or bash commands!!
#
# Everything is an object and you can assign and investigate objects. 
#
# This is how
#
# Use the pipe symbol | bottom left between the z and the SHIFT on my keyboard
#
# Pipe the results of your command to Get-Member if you want to do something different use Get-Help Get-Member
#
Get-ChildItem | Get-Member
# Now you can see the events, properties and methods for the object
# It is Better to do it like this though. Store the results in a variable using the $ to define the variable
#
# If you dont have SQL Agent on this machine this will fail. Try assigning the variable to a different service
#
$Service = Get-Service SQLSERVERAGENT
$Service | Get-Member -MemberType Method
# When you want to take it further Go back to Get-Help and read it. Don't always relay on the examples. Read more of it
# But you can also find help about concepts and the langauge
#
Get-Help About_C*
# You can also get the help online
#
Get-Help about_Comparison_Operators -Online
# Also Don't forget CTR + J in the ISE
#
cd $CurrentPath
powershell_ise.exe '02.ps1' -noprofile

##             Hopefully You Will Remember
#
#              Get-Command                Use the wildcard it's *
#              Get-Help                   With the command afterwards. Also for concepts
#              Get-Member                 You need to pipe the object to it use a $ 
#              CTRL + J                   Will show snippets they will help with syntax
#              
#              Now you can work out how to do it with Powershell
#              Hopefully enabling you to ease frustrations and learn more
#
#              Don't be afraid to ask for help pn social media and Technology specific forums
#              Or any of the Powershell focused web-sites too many to list here
